# Goal-Based Workout Recommendation System

## 🏋️‍♂️ Feature Overview

This feature recommends workouts to users based on their fitness goals.  
It predicts the most suitable goal category for a user and then maps it to specific workouts.

**Example Goals:**

- Weight Loss
- Muscle Gain / Strength
- Endurance / Cardio
- General Fitness / Maintenance

## 🔹 Dataset
 Workout Recommen
**Selected Dataset:** [Workout Preferences and Fitness Goals Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumedh1507/fitness-and-workout-dataset)

**Columns Used:**

- `program_length` (weeks)
- `time_per_workout` (minutes)
- `level` (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
- `equipment` (Bodyweight, Dumbbells, etc.)
- `goal` (Target fitness goal – the target variable)

## 🔹 Data Preprocessing

1. **Drop rare classes:** Classes with fewer than 5 samples were removed to prevent errors during train/test split.
2. **Encode categorical features:**
   - `level` and `equipment` were one-hot encoded.
3. **Scale numeric features:**
   - `program_length` and `time_per_workout` were standardized using `StandardScaler`.
4. **Train/Test Split:**
   - 80% train, 20% test with stratification on `goal`.

## 🔹 Algorithm Used

**Random Forest Classifier**

**Why Random Forest:**

- Handles categorical and numeric features well.
- Robust to overfitting for small-medium datasets.
- Easy to interpret and fast to train.

## 🔹 Model Training & Evaluation

- Trained on 80% of the filtered dataset.
- Evaluated on 20% test set.
- Metrics used:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score (per goal category)
  - Confusion Matrix
